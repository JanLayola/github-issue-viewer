# GitHub Issue Finder

filter, and sort GitHub repositories issues. This section provides an overview of the key features, technologies

## How to run it locally

- For this project, I decided to test [bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager. But you can use the package manager of your 
  choice. 

```bash
bun install # Install the dependencies
bun dev # Start the dev environment, localhost:3000 by default
```

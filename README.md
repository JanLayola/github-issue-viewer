# GitHub Issue Finder

This GitHub Issue Finder app is designed to offer a visually appealing and user-friendly interface  to browse, 
filter, and sort GitHub repositories issues. This section provides an overview of the key features, technologies  
used, and the project's purpose.

## Where can you try it?
https://github-issue-viewer-seven.vercel.app/

## How to run it locally

- For this project, I decided to test [bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager. But you can use the package manager of your 
  choice. 

```bash
bun install # Install the dependencies
bun dev # Start the dev environment, localhost:3000 by default
```
## Things that I missed because the time (althoug I think they are important)

- Tests! A lot of them!
- A reusable list compoennt
- Documentation (I like to use Storybook to document the UI components)
- And the extra features like filters, cache saving and other!
